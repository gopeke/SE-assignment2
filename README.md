#SE-Assignment 2 – Git & GitHub Practice
This is a my first README file on GitHub


This repository was created for CINS 5318 – Software Engineering Assignment #2 at Prairie View A&M University.
The goal was to get hands-on experience using Git and GitHub for version control, branching, collaboration, and conflict resolution.


## Assignment Overview

The assignment was divided into six parts:

Setting Up Git and GitHub – Installing Git, configuring username and email, and creating a GitHub account.

Creating a Repository and Initial Commit – Building a simple “Hello World” program and pushing it to GitHub.

Working with Branches – Creating a new branch (feature-1) and adding an enhancement.

Collaborating with Pull Requests – Opening and reviewing pull requests between teammates.

Resolving Merge Conflicts – Simulating and fixing conflicts between main and feature-2.

Documentation & Issues – Writing this README and tracking work through GitHub Issues.


## Project Files
File	Description
myCode.py	- Simple Python program used to demonstrate version control.
README.md	- This document explaining the purpose and process of the assignment.


How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SE-assignment2.git
cd SE-assignment2


2. Run the Python script: python myCode.py


## What I Learned

- Setting up and configuring Git locally.
- Managing branches and understanding how feature branches isolate changes.
- Using GitHub to collaborate through pull requests and reviews.
- Handling merge conflicts manually and learning how Git tracks file differences.
- Writing clear commit messages and maintaining a clean history.


## Known Issues & Enhancements
- [x] Fixed: Duplicate output issue (#1)
- [x] Added: User input feature (#2)


##Collaboration

This assignment was completed in coordination with my group member; Chidiebere Okafor.
The said teammate reviewed pull requests, provided feedback, and approved merges.
It was a practical exercise in professional software-development workflow.


##Conclusion

This repository captures the full lifecycle of a small software change — from setup and branching to collaboration, conflict resolution, and documentation — reflecting the same process used in real-world projects.
